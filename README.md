**Customer Acquisition vs Retention**

- Objective: Assess how different marketplaces perform in acquiring and retaining customers.
- Key Metrics:
- Total orders.
- Unique customers.
- Repeat orders (Repeat Orders = Total Orders - Unique Customers).
- Retention rate (% of repeat orders among total orders).
  
**Deliverables:**

- A summary of retention metrics by channel.
- Observations on which marketplaces drive customer loyalty and suggestions to improve retention.

**Marketplace Efficiency: COD vs Prepaid Orders**

- Objective: Compare the operational and financial efficiency of order types (COD vs Prepaid) across marketplaces.
- Key Metrics:
- Total sales.
- Total profit.
- Average profit margin by channel and order type.
  
**Deliverables:**
- A detailed breakdown of these metrics by channel and order type.
- Observations on payment method efficiency and strategies to optimize COD or incentivize prepaid adoption.


  # **Customer Acquisition vs. Retention**
  
- Bewakoof has the highest repeat orders, but its retention rate is still low (~0.3%).
- Flipkart and other marketplace channels have no repeat customers in this dataset, meaning all customers are unique.

**Observations & Suggestions:**

- The low retention rate suggests that customers are not returning for repeat purchases.
- Implement loyalty programs, discounts for repeat buyers, or subscription models to improve retention.

# **Marketplace Efficiency (COD vs. Prepaid Orders)**
- COD orders tend to have a slightly higher average profit margin than prepaid orders.
- Bewakoof COD orders have a 52.1% profit margin, while Prepaid is slightly lower at 48.2%.
- Flipkart and other channels also show similar trends where COD is slightly more profitable.

**Observations & Suggestions:**

- Since COD is more profitable, marketplaces should optimize logistics to reduce COD-related risks (e.g., non-deliveries).
- To encourage prepaid adoption, offer small incentives like cashback or extra discounts.
